# Digital Forensics Incident Response (DFIR) and Crisis Management

Welcome to my documentation for Digital Forensics & Incident Response(DFIR) and Crisis Management learning — focused on digital evidence acquisition, forensic analysis, and incident investigation.

Digital forensics has become a foundational skillset for cybersecurity professionals. Today’s security landscape demands practitioners who can:
- Collect and preserve digital evidence
- Investigate malware and identify breach vectors
- Analyze system artifacts across operating systems
- Reconstruct timelines and attacker activity
- Respond to security incidents efficiently and defensibly
The course covers core forensic principles that apply universally, while also diving deep into platform-dependent investigation techniques for multiple operating systems (Windows, Linux, and macOS).

This repository is part of my broader commitment to learning out loud and includes the basic concepts and techniques usually employed in digital forensics and malware analysis. The contents are divided into the following modules:
